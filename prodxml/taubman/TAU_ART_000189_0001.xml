    <dcterms:title>DANCER</dcterms:title>
    <dcterms:description>Based in Roanoke, Virginia Betty Branch earned both her BA and MA in tudio Art from Hollins University. her work has been the focus of numerous solo and international exhibitions. Over a thirty-year period, Branch has focused on the female form and has defined female rites of passage in both traditional terra cotta, earthware, and straw. she looks to impressive Cycladic Greek fertility goddesses and other sources of feminine genesis to form complex and substantial sculptural works that exude power and energy. Branch's female forms vacillate between the lush and the lissome. In Dancer, Branch captures the fluid cyclical motion of a woman's body captured in mid-dance, to the point of abstraction.</dcterms:description>
