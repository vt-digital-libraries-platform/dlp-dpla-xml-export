    <dcterms:title>DAURA WITH CANE AND BRUHE</dcterms:title>
    <dcterms:description>panish born and Virginia based painter Pierre Daura was a prominent figure in the development of European modernism. He is known for his participation in the Cercle et Carre, which was a group of artists that promoted geometric construction rather than the irrational abstraction by the urrealists. With his lifelong commitment to art, Daura once commented, \All I have ever wanted to do is to find a way to paint. I have painted. I have worked. I have given myself to my art. That is what I have wanted since my very early age... to be an artist, good or bad... that is what I am.\</dcterms:description>
