    <dcterms:title>Letter from Jennie Howard to Dr. Thomas H. Howard Postmarked Dec. 6th 1867</dcterms:title>
    <dcterms:description>Postmarked Dec. 6th 1867, this letter expresses Jennie Howard's ongoing disappointment that brother in law Dr. Henry Howard has not yet come to visit, although he has promised he will.
