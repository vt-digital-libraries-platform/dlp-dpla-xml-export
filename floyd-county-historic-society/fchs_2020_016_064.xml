    <dcterms:title>Letter from Jennie Howard to Dr. Thomas Henry Howard Dated June 15, 1869</dcterms:title>
    <dcterms:description>A personal correspondence from Jennie Howard, dated June 15, 1869, to her relative Dr. Thomas Henry Howard. Jennie discusses possibilities of another visit from Henry, and shares events such as a party that will be thrown by the Masons. She is keen to speak with him about his marriage prospects, and suggests a lady that is graduating, and will want to marry soon because, "that is next on the program." However, this woman is lacking in wealth, so Jennie says that if Henry can find a woman with riches he should, "move in that direction, for money is the lever that moves this world.</dcterms:description>
