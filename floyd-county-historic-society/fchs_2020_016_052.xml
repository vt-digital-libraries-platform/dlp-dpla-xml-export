    <dcterms:title>Letter from Jennie Howard to Dr. Thomas H. Howard Postmarked April 26th 1868</dcterms:title>
    <dcterms:description>A letter from Jennie Howard to Dr. Thomas Henry Howard, postmarked April 26th 1868. Jennie writes details about the recent election, sharing that all of the "Reconstructive" candidates were elected in Campbellton County, and she was glad that the Conservative candidates were defeated. She mentions that farming is the only prosperous pursuit, and that, "all are going to plant cotton extensively, some are experimenting with the different fertilizers." She asks if Dr. Howard could send her some "real Virginia Cabbage seed" so she can try to grow winter cabbage. She goes on to relay family updates concerning daughter Lillie as well as cousin Tom and his wife, who have a baby named Tazewell. She mentions that she would like to bring Lillie to Virginia next year when she is old enough to remember everyone, and that she would like Dr. Howard to visit before he is married and settled.</dcterms:description>
