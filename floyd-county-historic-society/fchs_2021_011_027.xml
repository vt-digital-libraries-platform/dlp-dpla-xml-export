    <dcterms:title>Shoemaker Anvil Size "E</dcterms:title>
    <dcterms:description>A cobbler's anvil originally belonging to Tazewell Sowers of Floyd County. He was listed in the 1870 census as a shoemaker at age 31, indicating that this tool is around 150 years old. This awl, along with a collection of other cobbler's tools, is said to have been passed down through four generations of the Sowers family. An awl is a thin metal shaft with a sharp point on the end. They have a large, gripping handle and are used to poke holes in heavy, thick materials like leather. When making a pair of leather shoes, a cobbler would use an awl to poke holes in the material and then use those holes to place their stitches. This awl has a long needle with hole for threading, and a beautifully curved wooden handle.</dcterms:description>
