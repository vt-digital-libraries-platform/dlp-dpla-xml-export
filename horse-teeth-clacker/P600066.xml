    <dcterms:description>In this model, note the presence of &lt;b&gt;deciduous&lt;/b&gt; (milk) incisors, which appear white and lack a central groove on their labial (front) surface. Each tooth has a distinct constricted neck, and the occlusal (chewing) surface is clearly oval in shape. All six incisors have erupted, allowing us to apply the Rule of 6: central incisors erupt around 6 days, intermediates at 6 weeks, and corners at 6 months. Additionally, signs of wear are visible on the occlusal surfaces of the corners. It takes about 6 months from the time of eruption for a new tooth to protrude far enough to reach its antagonist, the corner incisors are usually not in wear until the horse is about a year old. Based on these features, this model represents a horse approximately one year old.</dcterms:description>
