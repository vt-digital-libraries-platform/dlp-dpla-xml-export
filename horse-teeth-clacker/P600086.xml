    <dcterms:title>Horse teeth clacker P600086</dcterms:title>
    <dcterms:description>Age is assessed by examining the lower incisor teeth, which are easily accessible by simply opening the mouth.

All the incisors present are permanent and display a distinct central groove on their labial surfaces. Presence of the canine teeth indicate that this horse is about five years or more. Looking on the occlusal (chewing) surfaces, the dental cups can be clearly seen on the corner incisors (typically disappear around 8 years of age) and on the intermediate incisors (typically disappear around 7 years). In the central incisors, the cups are gone except for small parts as dark spots near the lingual surface. The cups of the central incisors completely disappear around 6 years. Based on the previous features and the shape of the surface of the occlusal surface which is almost triangular this specimen is estimated 6 years old.</dcterms:description>
